<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="../getStarted/cupojava/index.html">The "Hello World!" Application</a> lesson in the 
<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="../getStarted/index.html">Getting Started</a> trail. This lesson includes links to download the latest JDK for Windows, Linux, and Solaris. There are also instructions and links for the NetBeans&trade; IDE, which runs on all the above platforms.</p>

<p><a class="q" name="q2" id="q2">I already have the JRE. Why do I need the JDK?</a> The Java SE Runtime Environment, or JRE, allows you to run programs that have already been compiled and deployed. We hope you will use the Tutorials to expand your understanding of Java technology by modifying and extending the examples. To do this, you need the JDK.</p>
<p><a class="q" name="q5" id="q5">I&#39;m just not ready to upgrade to the latest JDK. Can I get the old Tutorials?</a> You can get the old tutorials from the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/archive-139210.html">Oracle Java Archive</a> page.</p>
<p><a class="q" name="q7" id="q7">Why doesn&#39;t Oracle provide software for Mac OS X</a>? Java platform software for Macintosh OS X is maintained by Apple Computer. Apple sometimes provides newer releases of the JDK as Beta software. For more information about the Java platform on Mac OS X, go to <a href="http://developer.apple.com/java">developer.apple.com/java</a>.</p>
